# Looking forward

#### Defensibility

Before you decide to commit your time to working on an open source project, or commit to stockpiling a utility token behind that project, it is certainly worth discussing the long term prospects. In the blockchain space, every good idea has lots of clones and forking iterations. So, why is Juris going to win in the long term?

#### First Mover Advantage

First, there is great strength in the "first mover" advantage, and only more-so in the context of the creation of the associated Jurist network. Bitcoin remained the dominant medium-of-exchange crypto currency despite thousands of competitors, many of which are technically superior. If all of the interested parties commit to the first mover, everyone has more of an incentive to improve the first mover, than to jump \(alone\) to an upstart platform. Juris has this advantage. Arbitration companies like JAMS persist because they have organized a registry of certified arbitrators. Juris intends not only to begin by partnering with such companies before launch, but to increase our pool through the Repchain protocol, which will allow the onboard of new Jurists.

#### The Juris Reputation System

In this context, the Reputation System is potentially more important for the persistence of the Juris Protocol, and the Juris Platform, than simply being the first to move. Stack Overflow was not the first place to talk about software, and Github was not the first place to distribute source code. But they are the dominant platforms today because they were a good place to develop, exhibit, and leverage a good reputation. And that reputation is only tangentially portable to other networks. This is the Juris Protocol's long term strength. Though most of the utility will be derived from open source software, the Juris master implementation will continue to thrive because of the power of the Proof of Judgment-based reputation system -- a novel innovation.

#### Jurists

Potential \(non-developer\) Jurists will want to commit to Juris Tokens quickly because holding JRS lets them move to accrue reputation sooner. This will allow them to advance more quickly to placement on the more lucrative PANELs. While the ability to fork the protocol is inherently simple, Jurists will be reluctant to leave JRS for alternatives because they cannot take the associated reputation with them. Better to stay and improve the system in which they are invested by taking part in governance functions also afforded by the holding of JRS and associated reputation.

#### Developers

Developers involved with the project will be incentivized through JRS rewards for codebase commits and bug bounties, and the value of tokens received for this effort will only be amplified by the above non-developer token use. Additionally, this allocation to developers will incentivize the developer community to use the Juris Protocol in their own smart contracts, spread the word to other developers, and to take part in future governance mechanisms to improve the protocol on an ongoing basis.

#### AI Arbitration

While Juris has no specific plans at this time, we would be remiss were we not to address a frequent corollary to blockchain technology conversations: artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Activity on the Juris protocol, and associated reputation chains, would amount to a source of judicial, dispute, and smart contract related data like the world has never seen. Anyone who knows AI/ML knows that data is an important crux of their application. Things learned from Juris Protocol data, with applied AI/ML, could have an impact on justice, dispute resolution, and judicial practice beyond current comprehension.

#### Beyond Arbitration

In preparation for a trial, lawyers will often 'war game' a case. The art of trial law is less in the details and the evidence, and more in the way a story is presented to a jury -- there's a reason that "courtroom drama" is a consistently popular television and movie genre. And it's not because evidence is so interesting. Mock trial and jury selection companies make a pretty penny providing services to aid in this version of trial preparation. Lawyers do their best to use these tools to test different variables in their story, and how to best select a jury to hear that story. Yet these "war games" are often slow, expensive, inaccessible to weaker parties, and still provide data of limited statistical relevance.

In this context, with minimal repurposing, the Juris Platform could provide a solution. The SNAP could be used to test different arguments and possible presentation of trial facts on a scale larger by factors when compared to what a mock trail company might provide. And at a greatly reduced price. What's more, the system could, by filtering for novice Jurists with no previous qualifications, approximate the input of an uninformed jury. This would create increased opportunity for novices to gain reputation in the system, while providing trial lawyers with a testing ground providing data from both professionals \(other lawyers\), and novices \(those peers that would make up a jury\).

#### Content Moderation

> - Mark Zuckerberg

As of this writing, Facebook continues to be embroiled in a new phase of social media network scale: public scrutiny. This is the result of reaching a scale at which unique problems are emerging.  

There have been hearings, and headlines, and podcast appearances. In a number of these appearances Zuckerberg has mention the above, the need for "a Supreme Court or appeals board." And he doesn't want it to be part of Facebook. If only for liability purposes, Facebook needs this system to be independent. As Zuckerberg himself likes to point out, they are very much problems more akin to those of governments, than software platforms.

When it comes to content moderation, these disputes, and conflicts are of a difficult nature, but one that Juris will have a platform apt to handle. In the United States law around the First Amendment and "indecent speech" frequently boils down to notions of "community standards." Making decisions based on these standards, and at the "community" level sure sounds like a job for a SNAP-like protocol (maybe with a geo-fence filter.)
