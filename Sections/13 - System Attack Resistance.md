**Section 13**
# System Attack Resistance

#### Sybil Attack

The reputation algorithm and Reputation Ssytem will make it very expensive to produce high ranked Jurists without providing value to the network. That value creates a prohibitive cost for the creation of new users \(in good standing\) which makes a Sybil attack on the Juris protocol itself extremely difficult. \(See [Reputation Blockchains Section](/11 - The Reputation System.md) for more on Reputation System sybil attack resistance.\)

#### 50%+1 Attack

On top of the mechanisms that make a 51% attack difficult on any blockchain platform, the bicameral structure of Juris governance will make us much more resistant to a 51% attack. Even if someone could control a super majority of Juris Proof of Stake they would be blocked by the Proof of Judgment chamber, composed of those with the highest reputation rankings, from forcing any changes to the Master Contract.
