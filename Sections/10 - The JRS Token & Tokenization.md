# The Juris Token \(JRS\) and Tokenization

The Juris Protocol will use a proprietary blockchain based token \(JRS\) to incentivize developers and Jurists to be involved and to improve the system. The use of this "tokenization" of resources allows us to provide aspects of the Protocol as an open source project. The goal of the JRS token is to capture the value inherent in a dispute resolution system, and to concretely distribute that value to the builders, the jurists, and the Juris community. With such a system in place The Juris Project will be able to focus on its mission to provide fair and just dispute resolution to the world... and not on profit motives.

#### A Note on Regulation

The conversation about how to treat new models of incentivisation and collective ownership is ongoing. In response, the goal of this portion of the paper is to lay out the intended philosophy and functionality of our Juris system tokenization and incentivisation. Early stages of Juris Protocol development, including token offerings, will strive to attain these goals within established U.S. securities law. We will not address regulation directly, or token offering details directly, as this is an ever shifting target and will continue to be this way for years.

#### Tokenization

> "It's not about Bitcoin, it's about blockchain" - Everybody

Tokenization is not a new concept. "Shares" of a company are simply tokens representing fractional ownership of that company. You give the company money, they give you "shares." And those shares come with certain rights -- voting, profit sharing, etc. Your shares used to be literal pieces of paper in a folder somewhere (and technically still are.) Now all the stock markets are digital. We've already tokenized the world. 

The Bitcoin Whitepaper, and the currency it spawned, brought us the first prominent example of blockchain technology in use to maintain a currency ledger, and employing an incentive mechanism. Regardless of one's feeling about Bitcoin as a currency or project, it has proved that blockchain technology is -- at the very least -- aptly used to build a functional *value based incentive* layer. Using tokens as "shares" to distribute the value captured in a system. Again, nothing new, I've just described stocks. Stocks capture the value in a company, and redistribute.

The confusion increases because blockchain is *so* good at digitizing this kind of system that it allows a fluidity of shares that the stock market system does not allow. When this happens tokens begin to feel more like money than they do stocks. Blockchain projects already exist in which we can use tokens to "pay" for things, and once we've learned a couple of the quirks, it's as simple as using a credit card, and at least as secure. This has given rise to the debate among founders, investors, and regulating bodies alike regarding the notion of a "utility token." A token that is more akin to frequent flier miles, or cash, than stock shares. Some tokens are clearly utility tokens. Some are clearly stocks. Most, including JRS, will be hybrids.

#### Incentivisation
Within a company, money is the single most concrete form of incentivisation. Everyone goes to work because they need to make money. They take that money into the world to pay for food, shelter, and so on. 

Slightly less concrete is the idea of stock, which is frequently given to employees at a company, particularly if they are involved early. This stock, representing a stake in the company itself, is a different kind of incentive. Here value is gained not by working and receiving money. Here value is gained by working for the success of the company as a whole. This means that the behavior this has the potential to promote is different. Here the incentive is not only to do your job, but it is to help others, and to make choices that will benefit the company at large... so your stock will go up.

As stock based incentivisation systems scale upward, regulations and transactional friction make it impractical to offer more fluid (or public) stock until there is enough value in the company for a small percentage of shares to be worth holding. If the average person owns stock in Apple it is a minute share of the company as a whole, but the company's overall value is so high that it is worth owning such a small share. "Going public" is a landmark in any company's growth. It represents reaching such a scale (such a value to the world) that the only way to grow is to share that value with any member of the public willing to purchase stock. In fact, until this decade "going public" was the *only* way to capture value at such scale.

Digital tokenization and blockchain infrastructure allow us to rethink this dynamic. They introduce the ability to incorporate stock-like incentivisation mechanisms at the very core of a protocol. They introduce the ability to capture the value of a system, and bake in a way to share that value with everyone responsible for creating it. These systems can work hand in hand with traditional "payment for services" models to drive a depth of platform use, trust in the protocol, platform growth, and value distribution previously reserved for public companies -- or more aptly -- public governments.

In the development of the JRS token model it is our consideration that the establishment of any sort of judicially compliant dispute resolution system must hew closer to that of a public court system, than a private company. The value captured by the system and any associated power in governance must be re-distributed to all members of the system who provide value.

### Token Functions
While a utility token functions in a manner more akin to that of money, a security token makes no bones about being a share of stock. A utility token makes the promise that a holder will be able to use it for a specific function. A security represents ownership of a portion of a company, project, protocol, or piece of property and often includes voting rights, or profit sharing. Additionally there has arisen the notion of a "work token," which gives the individual holder the right to contribute work, or attain work via a platform. 

Guided by the above definitions, **JRS tokens will be a hybrid model.**

#### JRS Utility Functions
Juris users who wish to avail themselves of the ability to trigger binding dispute resolution will be required to stake JRS on their contract. JRS will be available on open trading markets, and we will offer additional ways to acquire JRS as the technology landscape and regulation evolve. The minimum amount of JRS required to trigger the Juris protocol will be calculated based on a conversion, and priced to provide wide access to the protocol for smart contract users. 

When a dispute is triggered and Jurists are called in, the staked JRS will be allocated to the Jurists providing services. -- Additional fees, paid in native crypto or fiat currency, may also be layered on top of this transaction to represent payment for Jurist services. These fees will also be allocated evenly to the Jurists providing services.

_It is additionally technically feasible to require the staking of JRS token for certain Jurist actions within the system, although in the name of simplicity we are inclined to reserve this as an option to pursue if needed, as opposed to a foundational feature._

#### JRS Work Token Functions
Invitations to take part in SNAP judgments as a Jurist are open to all registered JRS holders worldwide, but not the general public. This ensures the possibility of a wide Jurist pool, while maintaining the involvement of only those users with a stake in the protocol. As a utility function the protocol will (when required for a requested action) check a Jurist's wallet for a non-zero JRS token balance in order to allow certain actions or transactions to proceed. In combination with the reputation system this work token functionality will increase the cost of fraudulent behavior, and limit rewards to those invested in the system.

_Similar to the above situation, it is technically feasible to use the quantity of work token possessed as means of calibrating the percentage of fees earned by a token holder. Again, we have reserved consideration of this function for future iterations in the event that we find a use case for this form of incentivisation._

#### JRS Security Functions
As a Jurist, an investor, or a community member, the JRS token will represent your share of the value captured by the Juris System, and your "stake" in that system. In this way JRS is most like a share of stock, earned by being part of the company, or purchased on account of belief in the value of the system, or desire to take part in the system through governance.

While the utility and work functions of the JRS token will create ongoing demand, the ultimate goal of the token is to create an underlying incentive mechanism for involvement and concern for the system itself. Jurists will want to earn the token attached to contracts as it will appreciate faster than any form of currency through the growth and proliferation of the protocol itself. (And in turn the proliferation of fair civil justice.)

Additionally, JRS function as security will be of increasing importance and value as the Juris Protocol, and Juris Corporate governance evolves to a bi-cameral liquid democracy model including a "Proof of Stake" component for community input on future development and policy.
