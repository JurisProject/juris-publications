Contract disputes occur. **Off the blockchain**, we resolve them through the court system or a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution \(ADR\). The more structured form of ADR, called “arbitration,” involves the airing of grievances before a panel of neutral jurists, who assess the facts and provide a decision. The power of arbitration is recognized internationally, with \~150 countries required by UN treaty to enforce arbitration judgments. In the United States neutral arbitration is a for-profit business. **On the blockchain**, there does not yet exist a protocol for the fair and efficient resolution of disputes in smart contracts. In this paper we introduce **Juris**, an open source dispute resolution system built for the blockchain, and **Juris Token \(JRS\),** a crypto-token to facilitate and incentivize Juris platform activity. Through the use of the Juris Protocol Mediation and Arbitration System, the disputed outcome of any smart contract, or standard contract, may be peacefully resolved among involved parties, or through United Nations compliant neutral arbitration. Additionally, the Juris Protocol introduces a novel reputation system based on prior certification, ongoing community activity, machine learning, and graph analysis. The protocol will rely on humans judgement at all levels, facilitating the involvement of professional human arbiters, and on-boarding and growth of novice arbiters. In this paper we review the Juris Protocol's improvements on the current state of the art, explore Juris as a framework, and describe a governance model for launch and future growth. Juris seeks to improve both the safety and security of smart contracts, to securely and efficiently provide for resolution of disputes, as well as provide global access to fair and balanced civil justice wherever blockchain usage extends. Ultimately, this will reduce the risk in the transition of traditional transactions onto blockchain-based alternatives and, in turn, increase broad adoption of blockchain technology and global access to justice in blockchain applications.
