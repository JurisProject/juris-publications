**Section 4**
# Value Proposition

#### A note:
_We are not building a full featured consumer facing dApp. We are building a **pick-and-shovel** tool that nearly every consumer-facing dApp will need. As a team, we will maintain transparency as we gauge the trade-offs between decentralized and traditional web infrastructure._

#### Value to Decentralized App \(dApp\) Creators

Dispute resolution is not the core focus of any dApp creator, but is a vital component of dApp functionality, especially when tokens or reputation scores are in play, as will always be the case in e-commerce, freelancing, crowdfunding, or financial applications. Such transaction disputes can be a sincere source of legal liability and thus existential risk for a fledgling application. By integrating Juris as their default dispute resolution mechanism, publishers can offload this risk in the most cost effective way possible.

#### Value to Contract Parties & Developers

The Juris platform will allow protocol users to add a layer of human-powered risk mitigation to their smart contracts at minimal expense. Developers will be able to earn JRS by contributing to the open source protocol.

#### Value to Jurists

Jurists and Contributors will be able to monetize adjudication experience and legal knowledge. They are the users that make our judgment system run. Anyone can become a Jurist, and earn JRS by doing so. Users with legal training will have a head start, but the ultimate measure of a Jurist's quality is the platform's reputation system which we call **standing**. 

Standing is calculated using machine learning and graph analysis \(like Google's pagerank.\) This score ranks Jurists and Contributors using their implicit and explicit endorsements of one another, which are generated through the normal activity of producing judgments and documents. Being able to prove their good judgment, by advertising their Juris Standing, may prove to be more valuable to Juris Community members than the JRS they can earn.
