## Value Proposition

_We are not building a full featured consumer facing dApp. We are building a pick-and-shovel tool that nearly every consumer-facing dApp will need.  _

### Value to Decentralized App \(dApp\) Publishers_ _

Dispute resolution is not the core focus of any dApp publisher, but is a vital component of dApp functionality, especially when tokens are changing hands\(e-commerce, freelancing, crowdfunding, financial securities\). Transaction disputes can be a sincere source of legal liability and thus existential risk for a fledgling application. By integrating Juris as their default dispute resolution mechanism, publishers can offload this risk -- for free.

### Value to Contract Parties

The Juris platform will allow CDK, Mediation Tools, and Adjudication Protocol users to add a layer of human-based risk mitigation to their smart contracts at minimal expense.

### Value to Jurists

Jurists are the users that make our judgement system run. Any one can become a Jurist, and earn JRS by doing so. Users with legal training will have an edge on other jurists, but the ultimate measure of a Jurists quality is the platforms **reputation score**. The reputation score is calculated using machine learning and graph analysis \(like google's pagerank\) using Jurists implicit endorsement of one another, which are generated through the normal activity of producing judgements.
