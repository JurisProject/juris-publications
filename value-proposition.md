## Value Proposition

### Contract Parties
The Juris platform will allow CDK, Mediation Tools, and Adjudication Protocol users to add a layer of human-based insurance to their smart contracts at minimal expense.   

### Decentralized App (dApp) Publishers
Dispute resolution is not the focus of most development teams, but can be a vital component of dApp function, especially when tokens are changing hands(e-commerce, freelancing, croudfinding, finacial securites). Transaction disputes can be a sincere source of legal liability and thus existential risk for a fledgling application. By integrating Juris as their default dispute resolution mechanism, publishers can offload this risk -- for free.

### Jurists
By joining the Juris platformâ€™s community of Jurists, legal professionals will increase the size of the market to which they are able to offer their services, while increasing the efficacy of the system, the value of time spent, and in turn their own JurisCoin holdings.
