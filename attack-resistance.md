## Attack Resistance

Intro? Attacking who? The foundation governance? The Protocol function/infrastructure? Is this about security broadly? \(Like, how can I trust that there won't be interference in my case in some way?\)

### 50%+1 Attack

On top of the mechanisms that make a 51% attack difficult on any blockchain platform, the bicameral structure of governance will make Juris much more resistant to a 51% attack. Even if someone could control a super majority of Juris PoS they would be blocked by the Judgment chamber from forcing any changes to the Foundation Contract.

### Sybil Attack

The PoT algorithm makes it very expensive to produce high ranked Jurists without providing value to the network. That value creates a cost to creating a new user \(in good standing\) which makes a Sybil attack extremely difficult.
