## Integrating Juris

To help us catch bugs in smart contracts early and often, JurisCoin will leverage several strategies that have emerged in the field of software development. Before we discuss how JurisCoin facilitates the production of safe and bug-free smart contracts, let’s enumerate some of the most well-known approaches to limiting bugs:

**Static typing:** statically typed languages can provide certain guarantees on correctness and safety if they pass a static type checker.

**Software testing:** software tests often surface bugs during development, and reduce the likelihood of introducing new bugs during change.

**Code reviews and audits:** when more than one pair of eyes are on software before release, we aren’t as likely to hear “I accidentally killed it” [https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/i-accidentally-killed-it-parity-wallet-bug-locks-150-million-in-ether/]

**Standardized libraries:** from Effective Java, 2nd Edition, Item 47: KNOW AND USE THE LIBRARIES:
	“By using a standard library, you take advantage of the knowledge of the experts who wrote it and the experience of those who used it before you.”
