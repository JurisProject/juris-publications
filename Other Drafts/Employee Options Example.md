### Employee Options

Steve is an early employee at the blockchain startup AwesomeCoin. They don’t have much money when he first comes onboard as they are gearing up for their Token Generation Event (TGE). So, they offer him what they can pay, as well as equity in the project in the form of a future grant of AwesomeCoin tokens to vest over time. The token option agreement is established via Ethereum smart contract, and contains a vesting schedule in which Steve will receive a grant of tokens six months after their successful TGE, a second grant at a year, and a final grant after two years. As a show of good faith (or maybe at Steve’s insistence) AwesomeCoin agrees to build the smart contract through the Juris CDK, and to include a “Smart Arbitration Clause.” The smart arbitration clause is sealed when each party attaches one JRS, and the smart contract is sealed when the AwesomeCoin tokens are placed in the associated holding account.

AwesomeCoin is, well, awesome, and the TGE is a runaway hit. Because their agreement is built via smart contract Steve automatically receives his AwesomeCoin tokens at six months, and at one year. In their second year AwesomeCoin begins to struggle a bit, and at one year and eleven months AwesomeCoin fires Steve “for cause.” They take steps to terminate the smart contract, which will prevent the final allocation of tokens, meant to occur in one more month.

This is the first Steve has heard of any disapproval of his performance, and he believes that he is being fired so AwesomeCoin can avoid handing over his next allocation of tokens. The day after he learns of his termination he triggers the arbitration button for this smart contract in his Juris dashboard. The contract is frozen, and the tokens are moved to a neutral holding wallet. He provides the details of the situation, his past performance reports, any other evidence he thinks is relevant to his case, and the outcome he thinks is fair. He wants his tokens, regardless of his firing. AwesomeCoin receives a notification that arbitration has been triggered, that the smart contract and the tokens are locked, and they are asked to provide their side of the story, and relevant evidence.

Worldwide, anyone holding JRS receives a notification that there is a case available for first round review. They log in, review the details as presented, and at small, but non-trivial cost, vote on what they believe to be a fair outcome. The report of their votes is returned to Steve and AwesomeCoin at the same time. In this case the neutral Jurists have decided overwhelmingly in Steve’s favor. They agree that something is amiss here.

Steve clicks to accept this verdict. In spite of the indication that they have a losing case, AwesomeCoin chooses not to accept the verdict. This moves the dispute to second round binding arbitration, this will take longer, cost more, and the decision is final. Three neutral Jurists in the highest reputation category are selected at random, and receive notifications inviting them to join a panel to review the details. Via the Juris platform they are able to discuss the case amongst themselves, and ask questions of AwesomeCoin and Steve. After deliberation they deliver their decision: Steve will receive 60% of the promised tokens, and the remaining 40% will be returned to AwesomeCoin. Via an associated brief the panel explains their finding that AwesomeCoin had presented legitimate justification for Steve’s firing,  that was not discovered by the company until early in the second year, yet because they failed to notify Steve and give him a chance to improve, he was entitled to compensation for time worked.

The case is closed on the Juris platform, the attached JRS is allocated to the involved Jurists, and any unused JRS is returned to Steve and AwesomeCoin.

Something involving two parties in a developing country with unstable local government.


Ideas: 

- Futures contract for produce (these are one of the most important financial instruments for reducing rural poverty, but you need to validate delivery of the crop)
- Property title dispute (tokenizing property is a big deal, could we tell a story about a disput there?)
- collateralized loan (tokenized collateral for a loan is in a smart contract, the collateral is released when enough crypto money is deposited in the contract . . . then something goes wrong maybe force majeure?) 
	- How are micro loans collateralized? Is this lack of contract enforcement an obstacle to a local collateralized debt system in the developing world?
