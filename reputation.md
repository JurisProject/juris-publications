# The Reputation System

If Juris is to be the go-to adjudication mechanism for smart contracts, parties must have confidence that their cases are arbitrated fairly by reputable individuals. This presents a challenge: how do we gauge fairness and reputability in a decentralized, anonymous, autonomous environment? We propose a trust framework—a *reputation system*—tightly integrated with the Juris platform as a solution to this challenge.

Broadly, the Juris Reputation System should have the following qualities:

- Reputation should be a reliable proxy for a person's ability to effectively arbitrate cases
- Reputation scores must be readily calculable, deterministic, and open
- Earning reputation legitimately should be straightforward, although difficult
- Earning reputation illegitimately should be so difficult as to be effectively impossible
- Reputation must be non-transferable and unsusceptible to commodification
- The system must have a sensible incentive structure: arbitrators are rewarded for sound judgement and effective prosecution, and punished for poor judgement or bad behavior
- The system should be resistant to malicious actors, sybil attacks, and abuse through collusion
- After initialization, the system should be fully autonomous and decentralized

The technical implementation of Juris' reputation system will be an off-platform blockchain, with reputation (or *rep*) reified as a crypto token.

## Earning Reputation
This is the section that will be of the greatest interest to Jurists. Earning rep keeps you in good standing and earning a lot of rep makes you elev

###The Easy Stuff

Eat your vegetables and finish what you start. This stuff doesn’t really prove that you have good judgement, but failing to do it proves that you’re a bit of a flake and shouldn’t be trusted to make good judgement. So if you make an opening vote, and don’t make a final vote or endorse an opinion, you get dinged hard.
