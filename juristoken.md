## The Juris Token \(JRS\)

The Juris Protocol will use a proprietary blockchain based security token \(JRS\) to incentivize developers and Jurists to be involved and improve the system. The use of this "tokenization" of resources allows us to provide the Protocol as an open source project.

#### A Note on Regulation

The conversation about how to treat new models of incentivisation and collective ownership is ongoing. In response, the goal of this portion of the paper is to lay out the intended philosophy and functionality of our systems of tokenization and incentivisation. Early stages of Juris Protocol development, including token offerings, will strive to attain these goals within established U.S. securities law. We will not address regulation directly, or token offering details directly, as this is an ever shifting target, and will continue to be this way for years.

#### Tokenization

> "It's not about Bitcoin, it's about blockchain"

Tokenization is not a new concept. "Shares" of a company are simply tokens representing fractional of ownership of that company. You give the company money, they give you "shares." They used to be literal pieces of paper in a folder somewhere. Now all the stock markets are digital. And those shares come with certain rights -- voting, profit sharing, etc. 

The Bitcoin whitepaper brought us the first prominent example of blockchain technology in use. Regardless of one's feeling about Bitcoin as a currency or project, it has proved that blockchain technology is -- at the very least -- aptly used to build a functional *value* layer. Using tokens as "shares" to distribute the value captured in a system. Again, nothing new, these are stocks.

The confusion increases because blockchain is *so* good at digitizing this kind of system that it allows a fluidity of shares that the stock market system does not allow. When this happens tokens begin to feel more like money than like stocks. Blockchain projects already exist in which we can use tokens to "pay" for things. This has given rise to the debate among founders, investors, and regulating bodies alike, regarding the notion of a "utility token." A token that is more akin to frequent flier miles, or cash, than a stock.

#### Incentivisation
Within a company, money is the single most concrete form of incentivisation. Everyone goes to work because they need to make money. They take that money into the world to pay for food, shelter, and things like that. 

Slightly less concrete is the idea of stock, which is frequently given to employees at a company, particularly if they are involved early. This stock, representing a stake in the company itself is a different kind of incentive. Here value is gained not by working and receiving money. Here value is gained through the success of the company as a whole. This means that the behavior this has the potential to promote is different. Here the incentive is not only to do your job, but it is to help others, and to make choices that will benefit the company at large... so your stock will go up.

Stock is generally only available to early employees because there is only so much of a company to divy up. And regulations, and transactional friction make it impractical to offer more fluid stock until there is enough value in the system for a small percentage of shares to be worth holding. If the average person owns stock in Apple it is a minute share of the company as a whole, but the company's overall value is so high that it is worth owning such a small share.

Digital tokenization and blockchain infrastructure allow us to rethink this dynamic. They introduce the ability to incorporate stock-like incentivisation mechanisms, hand in hand with traditional "payment for services" models to drive platform use, trust in the protocol, platform growth, and value distribution.

#### Security Tokens
While a utility token functions in a manner more akin to that of money, a security token makes no bones about being a share of stock. A security represents ownership of a portion of a company, project, protocol, or piece of property. A utility token makes the promise that a holder will be able to use it for a specific utility. A security token is meant to represent stake in a system.

Guided by the above definitions, **JRS tokens will be a hybrid model.**

#### Staking

JRS is not only an incentive mechanism, but also a fundament part of the system itself. Invitations to take part in SNAP judgements as a Jurist are open to all JRS holders worldwide. This ensures a wide Jurist pool, and the involvement of only those users with a stake in the protocol. Additionally, this same staking function will be relevant as foundation governance evolves to a "Proof of Stake" model for community input on protocol development and evolution.

#### Contract Clarity

In the context of justice and dispute resolution clarity is important. The ability to quickly recognize that a contract is or isn't protected by the Juris Protocol is vital to its usability. If the CDK is included, and there is JRS attached to the contract, then the Juris Protocol is active, and the smart contract is protected. If there is no JRS, the CDK is not active. In this case, the use of a native token \(presumably the same token used as currency on the chain in question\) would create a potentially confusing need to segregate currency involved as part of the transaction from identical native currency set aside to "sign" the Juris CDK. This lack of clarity could result not only in user or contract code mishaps, but could result in legal confusion as to whether or not the CDK arbitration clause was ultimately agreed upon by both parties.
