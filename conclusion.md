## Conclusion

Disputes happen, software has bugs, humans disagree, and humans misunderstand: for blockchain based technologies and smart contracts to truly take hold they will need to acknowledge this, and systems must evolve.

Smart contracts and blockchain technologies evolve the way that transactions and agreements take place between people. But they will never truly take hold if they do not arrive bearing an equally evolved system of enforcement and dispute resolution. The innovation behind the first contract was not simply the idea of an agreement put on paper, but an agreement made enforceable.
