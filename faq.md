### APPENDIX FAQs

Why does this need a token? Why not run the economy on BTC or ETR?
This is the most important question to ask of the current generation of blockchain companies, and almost all of them fail it. 

 five reasons. 
 
1. The way that the currency interacts with the rep chain.
2. The token is used to mark jurists
3. It enables the governance mechanisms. 
4. A token that is only used to deliver dispute resolution can give all parties to a contract confidence that the contract is well faithfully enforced. 
5. The need for an independent monetary policy. The prices of crypto currencies (EHT included) move A LOT! Juris is going to need to run it’s own monetary policy. 
6. Tethering the token across contract chains. -- when Juris moves to NEO, having a ETH derivative coin (as opposed to straight up ETH) will make coupling it to the other chain easier. 
7. facilitate and mediate partnerships. (give a bunch of coin to a partner to achieve alignment)

###### Why does this need to be decentralized? Can’t you just run this on one server?

There’s actually two things we are decentralizing, justice and reputation. 
Justice:
Apple, Signal, Telegram, and Keybase enable distributed end-to-end encrypted communication because your communication is no one else's business. Strongly encrypted communications prevent identity theft, stalking, government censorship, and forged communications. 
The world needs strongly encrypted justice for the same reasons. Not everyone enjoys swift impartial contract enforcement; and no one enjoys it at a low cost. To prevent corrupt governments and criminal organizations from tampering in dispute resolution, we need strong encrypted and decentralized system where the assets and contracts are never under the control of the juris foundation. 
What were planning would be impossible to do in a centralized way. 
Extending the force for contract law (with the assets held in smart escrow) to the entire planet is a radical idea. 
If this were on a centralized server, it would mean that Juris would be subject to all sorts of legal constraints.  If control of the assets were constantly passing through a central server we controlled, we would be crushed under a constant barrage of seizure claims form regional governments. It would be impossible to bring the justice of contract law to the world under that framework. 

Reputation (proof-of-judgement):
A reputation chain is most valuable to people on the chain if it is visible to everyone. We could publish an open API, but that would incur high recurring security and attack resilience costs and Jurist would have to trust us that we would continue to make their proof-of-judgement public. By running reputation as a blockchain, we make it maximally available (forever) without having to deal with those costs.
