## Looking forward


### Defensibility

Before you decide to commit your time to working on an open source project or stockpiling a utility token behind it, it would be really nice to know if it’s going to win in the long term. Every good idea has lots clones and forking iteration. Why is Juris going to win in the long term?

First mover advantage is nice. Bitcoin remained the dominant medium-of-exchange crypto currency despite thousands of competitors, many of which are technically superior. If all of the interested parties commit to the first mover, everyone has more of an incentive to improve the first mover, than to jump (alone) to an upstart platform. Juris has this advantage.

Juris also has something more important. Stackoverflow was not the first place to talk about software and Github was not the first place to distribute sourcecode. But they are the dominant platform because they were a good place to develop a reputation, and you can’t take that reputation with you. This is Juris’ long term strength. Though most of the utility of the platform will be derived from open source CDK’s, the Juris foundation will be able to able to continue to derive because of the lock-in power of the reputation system -- a novel innovation, and first of its kind in the blockchain ecosystem. Though it is similar to earn.com’s leveraging of social networks. 

People will want to commit to Juris coin quickly because of ability of first movers to quickly accrue reputation. Everyone will be reluctant to leave, because you can’t take that reputation with you. Far better to stay and improve the system you’re invested in. 

### AI arbitration

There's nothing about being a jurist that a machine couldn't figure out and get very good at. In fact the Juris platform would be the best enviroment yet constructed for a machine to learn to make judicial judments.[More to come]

### Beyond arbitration

In preperation for a trial, lawyers will often 'war game' a case. Generating a model of everything that could happen at a trial, as well as modeling thier optimal resonse. These war games are often slow, expensive, and of very low quailty. By descibing thier war game in terms of a smart contract, they could quickly and cheaply croud source opion generation. There are many similar uses for the juris platform and we will expand upon them in future blogposts.
