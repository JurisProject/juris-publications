## Looking forward

### Defensibility

Before you decide to commit your time to working on an open source project, or commit to stockpiling a utility token behind that project, it is certainly worth discussing the long term prospects. In the blockchain space, every good idea has lots clones and forking iterations. So, why is Juris going to win in the long term?

First, there is great strength in the "first mover" advantage, and only more-so in the context of the creation of the associated Jurist network. Bitcoin remained the dominant medium-of-exchange crypto currency despite thousands of competitors, many of which are technically superior. If all of the interested parties commit to the first mover, everyone has more of an incentive to improve the first mover, than to jump \(alone\) to an upstart platform. Juris has this advantage. Arbitration companies like JAMS persist because they have organized a stable of certified arbitrators. Juris intends not only to begin by partnering with such companies before launch, but to increase our pool through the repchain protocol, which will allow the onboard of new Jurists.

In this context, the repchain is potentially more important for the persistence of the Juris Protocol, and Juris Oracle, than simply being the first to move. Stack Overflow was not the first place to talk about software and Github was not the first place to distribute source code. But they are the dominant platforms today because they were a good place to develop, exhibit, and leverage a good reputation, and that reputation is only tangentially portable to other networks. This is Jurisâ€™ long term strength. Though most of the utility of the platform will be derived from open source software, the Juris Foundation's implementation will continue to thrive because of the power of the legal judgement based reputation system -- a novel innovation.

Potential non-developer Jurists will want to commit to JurisCoin quickly because holding JRS lets them move to accrue reputation sooner, thus advancing more quickly to placement on the more lucrative PANELs. While the ability to fork the protocol is inherently simple, Jurists will be reluctant to leave JRS for alternatives because they cannot take the associated reputation with them. Better to stay and improve the system in which they are invested by taking part in governance functions also afforded by the holding of JRS.

Developers involved with the project will be incentivized through JRS rewards for codebase commits and bug bounties, and the value of tokens received for this effort will only be amplified by the above non-developer token use. Additionally, this allocation to developers will incentivize the developer community to use the Juris Protocol in their own smart contracts, spread the word to other developers, and to take part in future governance mechanisms to improve the protocol on an ongoing basis.

### AI Arbitration

While the Juris Foundation has no specific plans at this time, we would be remiss were we not to address a frequent corollary to blockchain technology: artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

Activity on the Juris protocol, and associated reputation chains, would amount to a source of judicial, dispute, and smart contract related data like the world has never seen. Anyone who knows AI/ML knows that data is an important crux of application. Things learned from Juris Protocol data, with applied AI/ML, could have an impact on justice beyond current comprehension.

### Beyond arbitration

In preperation for a trial, lawyers will often 'war game' a case. Generating a model of everything that could happen at a trial, as well as modeling thier optimal resonse. These war games are often slow, expensive, and of very low quailty. By descibing thier war game in terms of a smart contract, they could quickly and cheaply croud source opion generation. There are many similar uses for the juris platform and we will expand upon them in future blogposts.
